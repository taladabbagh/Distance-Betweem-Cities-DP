## Project Overview

The problem of finding the shortest or most efficient distance between cities is a classic example of optimization. This project uses **Dynamic Programming** to solve this problem efficiently. The implementation:

- Represents cities and distances as a graph.
- Uses a DP approach to avoid redundant calculations and improve performance.
- Outputs the optimal distance between two cities.

This project is written in **Java** and is designed to be clear, modular, and easy to extend.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Cities and distances are represented as a graph (e.g., adjacency matrix or list).
- **Dynamic Programming Solution**: Implements a DP table to store intermediate results and avoid recalculating distances.
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Handles larger datasets efficiently due to the optimized DP approach.
- **Customizable**: Can be extended to include additional constraints, such as traffic or road conditions.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Figuring Out the DP Relation and Table Design
- **Problem**:  
  When I first started implementing the DP solution, I struggled to define the correct **DP relation** and design the **DP table**. I knew I needed to store intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations, but I wasnâ€™t sure how to structure the table or what the recurrence relation should look like. This made it difficult to translate the problem into a working DP solution.

- **Solution**:  
  To overcome this challenge, I took the following steps:
  1. **Broke Down the Problem**: I started by analyzing smaller subproblems. For example, I asked myself, "What is the shortest distance from City A to City B if I only consider one intermediate city?"
  2. **Identified the Recurrence Relation**: After analyzing smaller cases, I realized that the shortest distance to a city could be expressed in terms of the shortest distances to its neighboring cities. This led me to the recurrence relation:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j])
     ```
     where `dp[i][j]` represents the shortest distance from city `i` to city `j`, and `k` is an intermediate city.
  3. **Designed the DP Table**: I created a 2D DP table where each cell `dp[i][j]` stores the shortest distance from city `i` to city `j`. I initialized the table with the direct distances between cities and then iteratively updated it using the recurrence relation.
  4. **Validated the Solution**: I tested the DP solution with various graphs to ensure it worked correctly and handled edge cases.

This process helped me not only solve the problem but also deepen my understanding of how to approach DP problems in general.
